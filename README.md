# Biological-Databases
Biological data analysis 

Motivation
----------
“Biological Databases” is a misnomer, in fact most of them are just structured as complex text files. 
This repository is aimed to understand sources for biological data and to build the tools used to query them. By 
utilizing a culminations of statistical analysis, algorithmic principles, and biological technologies we can make 
biological discoveries. 

What it does
